<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The cheeseburger is a classic dish that is simple to make and always tastes delicious. It is probably my all time favorite food due to customizability, convenience, and some of the best flavor I've ever tasted.
They can be grilled or cooked in a skillet, seasoned however you prefer, and you can add any toppings you'd like. Egg on top? Sure, why not! Vegetables if you'd like, your choice of cheese, make it spicy or mild. Go crazy and add whatever sauce or condiments you'd like. When it comes to cheeseburgers, the world is your oyster!</p>
